# üè• Hospital Appointment Management System

# Project Description

This is a web-based Hospital Appointment Management System built using Django. The system allows patients to register, log in, and schedule appointments with doctors. Doctors can manage their own appointments, while the admin oversees the entire system.

The system is designed to simplify appointment booking, reduce administrative workload, and provide an organized view of upcoming appointments. Future improvements include email notifications and doctor-specific dashboards.
